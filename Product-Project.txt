"What I understood about Microservices as a beginner, who has just had hands-on experiences:"

Firstly Microservices is called business logic in other hand, is written by developer as code using different programming language.
managemnet

Secondly , How to run and where to run these codes, On which platform like vmawre,aws,google cloud,azure ,on premise physical server, serverless or on kubernetes as container.
So if we want to run as containerization , it need to buid , need to package the docker imagefile including business logice code. Everysingle miscroservices have image file.

Thidly, those container image file storage in repository like github, docker hub, aws (ECR), google (container registry), azure (container register) etc.
we have to write yaml file involved those image file to deploy on kubernetes. That's why we have kubernetes clusters.It doesn't matter our business logic code where to run, where to store, it can happen on any cloud provider,we must focus only technology pattern of infrastructure.

Docker is one of the implementation container like containerd, rocket etc. They do same thing like package application,come out image file, run image on kubernetes.

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestra like openshift, docekr swarm.A lot of miscroservices need connectivity, securtiy ,observability . Thatis why we need servicemesh is called application networking. Kuberneters can not support fully those traffic management. So need to use istio , calcio linkerd,consul etc leading to servicemesh.
